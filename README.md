## AG-UI Specification


AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based, (maximally-accomodating) protocol for agent-human collaboration:
* During agent executions, agent backends **emit events _compatible_ with one of AG-UI's 16 standard event types**
* Agents can **accept one of a few simple AG-UI compatible inputs**

AG-UI has a built-in middleware layer that facilitates maximal accomodation, including:
* Support for **any transport mechanism** (SSEs, webhooks, WebSockets, etc.)
* Event **compatibility** without requiring exact format matching
