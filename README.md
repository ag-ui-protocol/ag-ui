## Introducing AG-UI

AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes how AI agents connect to front-end applications.

AG-UI helps developers build next-generation AI-native applications that need **real-time agent<>user interactivity**, **live state synchronization**, and **human-in-the-loop + human-on-the-loop collaboration**.
