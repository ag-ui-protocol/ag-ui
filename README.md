## AG-UI Specification

AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based, (maximally-accomodating) protocol for agent-human interaction:
* During agent executions, agent backends **emit events _compatible_ with one of AG-UI's 16 standard event types**
* Agents can **accept one of a few simple AG-UI compatible inputs**

AG-UI has a built-in middleware layer that facilitates maximal accomodation, including:
* Support for **any event transport mechanism** (SSEs, webhooks, WebSockets, etc.)
* Event **compatibility** without requiring exact format matching

AG-UI also includes a reference HTTP protocol implementation & an associated reference connector.

## AG-UI Showcase: The AG-UI Dojo (Building-Blocks Viewer)

The [ag-ui dojo](https://feature-viewer-langgraph.vercel.app/) showcases many of the building blocks that ag-ui supports.

The building blocks are designed to be simple and focused -- between 50-200 lines of code.
