# Architecture

This document describes the technical architecture and design decisions for the AG-UI Go SDK.

## Overview

The AG-UI Go SDK is designed as a modular, extensible framework for building AI agents that can seamlessly integrate with front-end applications. The architecture follows Go best practices and emphasizes clean separation of concerns, testability, and performance.

## Design Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture
- Clear separation between public API and internal implementation
- Dependency inversion through interfaces
- Minimal coupling between components

### 2. Performance First
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Efficient memory management
- Connection pooling and reuse
- Streaming-oriented design

### 3. Type Safety
- Strong typing throughout the API
- Interface-based design for extensibility
- Compile-time guarantees over runtime checks

### 4. Extensibility
- Pluggable transport layer
- Middleware system for cross-cutting concerns
- Event-driven architecture

## Core Components

### Event System

The event system is the foundation of the AG-UI protocol:

```go
type Event interface {
    ID() string
    Type() string
    Timestamp() time.Time
    Data() interface{}
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Interface-based design for extensibility
- Immutable events for consistency
- Type-safe event data access
- Timestamp for ordering and debugging

### Agent Interface

Agents are the core abstraction for AI functionality:

```go
type Agent interface {
    HandleEvent(ctx context.Context, event Event) ([]Event, error)
    Name() string
    Description() string
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Context-aware for cancellation and timeout
- Multiple response events for complex interactions
- Simple interface for easy implementation
- Descriptive metadata for discovery

### Transport Layer

The transport layer is designed to be pluggable:

```go
type Transport interface {
    Send(ctx context.Context, event Event) error
    Receive(ctx context.Context) (<-chan Event, error)
    Close() error
}
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Channel-based streaming for Go idioms
- Context support for cancellation
- Error handling through return values
- Resource cleanup through Close()

## Concurrency Model

### Event Processing
- Each agent handles events concurrently
- Connection-specific goroutines for I/O
- Context-based cancellation throughout
- Graceful shutdown support

### Connection Management
- Connection pooling for HTTP transport
- Per-connection goroutines for WebSocket
- Backpressure handling through buffered channels
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### State Synchronization
- Copy-on-write semantics for state updates
- JSON Patch operations for efficient updates
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
1. **Protocol Errors**: Invalid events or protocol violations
2. **Transport Errors**: Network or connection issues
3. **Agent Errors**: Agent-specific processing errors
4. **System Errors**: Resource exhaustion or system failures

### Error Propagation
- Errors bubble up through the call stack
- Context cancellation for operation timeouts
- Graceful degradation where possible
- Detailed error information for debugging

### Retry Strategy
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- Dead letter queues for unprocessable events
- Configurable retry policies

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Pluggable authentication middleware
- Token-based authentication support
- TLS/SSL transport encryption
- CORS support for web clients

### Validation
- Event schema validation
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Resource consumption limits

### Isolation
- Agent sandboxing for tool execution
- Memory and CPU limits
- Network access control
- File system restrictions

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- Object pooling for frequently allocated types
- Zero-copy operations for large payloads
- Streaming processing for large datasets
- Garbage collection optimization

### Network Efficiency
- Connection multiplexing
- Compression for large events
- Batching for small events
- Keep-alive connections

### Caching
- Event caching for replayed interactions
- Connection state caching
- Schema validation caching
- Tool result caching

## Configuration

### Environment-based Config
```go
type Config struct {
    Transport    TransportConfig
    Encoding     EncodingConfig
    Middleware   MiddlewareConfig
    Agent        AgentConfig
}
```

### Configuration Sources
