# Naming conventions

Add your package under `integrations/` with docs and tests.

If your integration is work in progress, you can still add it to main branch.
You can prefix it with `wip-`, i.e.
(`integrations/wip-your-integration`) or if you're a third party
contributor use the `community` prefix, i.e.
(`integrations/community/your-integration`).

For questions and discussions, please use
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/discussions).
