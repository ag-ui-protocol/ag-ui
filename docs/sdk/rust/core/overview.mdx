# ag-ui-core (Rust)

The core crate defines the shared types and event model used across the Rust SDK. Client implementations (like ag-ui-client’s HttpAgent) exchange RunAgentInput and stream Event<StateT> values defined here.

Install:

```bash
cargo add ag-ui-core
```

## What’s inside

- Types: messages, identifiers, tools, context, RunAgentInput
- Events: strongly-typed streaming events emitted by agents
- Traits: AgentState and FwdProps bounds used by client crates

## Relationship with ag-ui-client

- ag-ui-core provides the data model and event protocol
- ag-ui-client provides the transport and execution orchestration
