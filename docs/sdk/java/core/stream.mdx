# Event Stream

Streaming is built around `IEventStream<T>` with a concrete `EventStream<BaseEvent>` implementation.

## IEventStream

Core methods:

- `void next(T event)` — emit an event
- `void error(Throwable error)` — signal error and terminate
- `void complete()` — signal completion
- `boolean isCancelled()` — check cancellation (for cooperative cancellation)

## EventStream

Utility implementation that accepts three lambdas: onNext, onError, onComplete. Used by `AbstractAgent` and Spring `AgUiService`.

```java
IEventStream<BaseEvent> stream = new EventStream<>(
  event -> { /* handle event */ },
  error -> { /* handle error */ },
  () -> { /* handle complete */ }
);
```
