# ag-ui-client

The Java Client SDK provides agent connectivity options for AI systems. It builds on the core types and events to deliver flexible connection methods to agent implementations.

## AbstractAgent

`AbstractAgent` is the base agent class for implementing custom agent connectivity. Extend this class and implement `run` to bridge your service to AG-UI.

- Configuration — agent ID, messages, and state
- Core Methods — runAgent, subscribe, message/state helpers
- Protected Methods — event handling hooks
- Properties — state and message tracking

</Card>

## HttpAgent

Concrete implementation for HTTP-based agent connectivity using an injected `BaseHttpClient` implementation.

- Configuration — agentId, threadId, httpClient
- Methods — run via HTTP streaming, close
- Builder — fluent configuration with validation

## AgentSubscriber

Event-driven subscriber system for handling agent lifecycle events and state mutations during execution.

- Event Handlers — lifecycle, message, tool call, and state events
- Usage Examples — logging, persistence, error handling patterns
- Integration — register and use subscribers with agents
