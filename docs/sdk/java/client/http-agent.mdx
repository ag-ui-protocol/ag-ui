# HttpAgent

`HttpAgent` extends `AbstractAgent` to provide HTTP-based connectivity to remote AI agents. It delegates streaming to a `BaseHttpClient` implementation and forwards incoming events to subscribers.

## Configuration

Use the builder to construct an instance:

```java
HttpAgent agent = HttpAgent.builder()
  .agentId("my-agent")
  .threadId("thread-123")
  .httpClient(myHttpClient)
  .messages(new ArrayList<>())
  .state(new State())
  .debug(true)
  .build();
```

Required: `agentId`, `threadId`, `httpClient`

## Methods

- `protected void run(RunAgentInput input, IEventStream<BaseEvent> stream)` — streams events via `httpClient.streamEvents`
- `void close()` — closes the underlying HTTP client

## Builder

Fluent builder with validation. Required fields must be set or an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
