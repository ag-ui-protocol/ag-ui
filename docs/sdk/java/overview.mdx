---

The AG-UI Java SDK provides a robust and idiomatic way to connect Java applications to AG-UI agents. 
It enables real-time streaming communication through Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing you to build intelligent agent-powered applications with Go.

## Installation

Add the SDK as a maven dependency:

```xml
```

## Quick Start


## Package Structure

The Java SDK is organized into several focused packages, each handling a specific aspect of the AG-UI protocol:

### Core Package (`core/events`)
The foundation of the SDK, providing event types, interfaces, and decoding capabilities. This package defines all the event structures used in AG-UI communication, including text messages, tool calls, state management, and lifecycle events.
