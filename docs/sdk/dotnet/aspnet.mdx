The most common way to integrate Agent User Interaction Protocol agents
currently is over HTTP which frontends like
[CopilotKit](https://www.copilotkit.ai) can use via the AG-UI
[HttpAgent](/concepts/agents#httpagent) agent implementation.

For that reason the .NET SDK provides a simple extension method to register a
[Minimal API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview)
POST endpoint that can be used to expose agents:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddChatClient(
    new ChatClientBuilder(myProviderIChatClient)
        .UseFunctionInvocation()
);

var app = builder.Build();

var agentsGroup = app.MapGroup("/agents");

agentsGroup.MapAgentEndpoint(
    "my-agent-name",
    sp => {
        var chatClient = sp.GetRequiredService<IChatClient>();
        return new ChatClientAgent(chatClient);
    }
);
```

This will create a POST endpoint at `/agents/my-agent-name` that accepts the
`RunAgentInput` body and returns a server-sent-events stream of the Agent User
Interaction Protocol events by invoking the provided agent.

You can configure the endpoint like any other one, including adding all the same
authentication / authorization / policy behaviour you would expect from ASP.NET.
