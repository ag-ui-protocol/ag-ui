# The StatefulChatClientAgent

The `StatefulChatClientAgent` is a specialised agent implementation that derives
from `ChatClientAgent` in order to provide frontend-agent state collaboration.

It relies on `ChatClientAgent` to provide all the same core functionality, but
tweaks the system message to direct the LLM to actively read and write to the
shared state of the agent, while registering new backend tools that allow the
agent to do so.

It emits the necessary Agent User Interaction Protocol events to handle state
synchronisation between the frontend and the agent, allowing for a rapid
bootstrapping of this common scenario.

<Warning>
This agent is experimental and may not provide the best results in all scenarios.

It relies heavily on a hardcoded system message that wraps the configured one,
and so may sometimes fail to always produce the expected behaviour or interact
with the shared state in all cases.

It is recommended to use this agent to bootstrap your proof of concept, and then
use it as a reference to implement your own agent from `ChatClientAgent` or
`IAGUIAgent` that is tailored to your specific use case.

</Warning>

## Usage

```csharp
record Recipe(
    string Name,
    string Description,
    string Ingredients,
    string Instructions
);

var myProviderIChatClient = GetProviderIChatClient();
var chatClient = new ChatClientBuilder(myProviderIChatClient)
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .Build();

var agent = new StatefulChatClientAgent<Recipe>(
    chatClient,
    // Define initial state for the agent to begin with if not provided by the run input
    new Recipe(),
    new StatefulChatClientAgentOptions<Recipe>
    {
        SystemMessage = "You can override the system message passed in the RunAgentInput",
        ChatOptions = new ChatOptions
        {
            Tools = [
                AiFunctionFactory.Create(
                    MyDotnetDelegate
                )
            ]
        }
    }
)
```

## Options

The agent accepts an options type `StateChatClientAgentOptions<TState>` that
derives from `ChatClientAgentOptions` and allows you to provide all the same
options as you would to a `ChatClientAgent` - it does not currently have any
additional options.

## Extending the Agent

The agent can also be extended by deriving from it, but it does not currently
offer any additional functionality beyond what `ChatClientAgent` provides, but
it does allow you to override the same methods as you would be able to when
deriving from `ChatClientAgent`.

<Warning>
  Beware deriving from this agent, as if you interfere with the methods it
  overrides, you may as well just derive from `ChatClientAgent` instead.
