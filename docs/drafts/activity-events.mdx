  Proposal for representing ongoing agent progress between chat messages

# Activity Events Proposal

## Summary

### Problem Statement

Users want to render "activity" updates inline with chat, not just at run start
or end. Currently, there's no standardized way to represent ongoing agent
progress between chat messages.

### Motivation

AG-UI is extended with **ActivityEvents** and **ActivityMessages** to represent
ongoing agent progress in between chat messages. This allows frameworks to
surface fine-grained activity updates chronologically, giving users immediate
visibility into what an agent is doing without waiting for the next message or
run boundary.

## Status

- **Status**: Draft
- **Author(s)**: Markus Ecker (mail@mme.xyz)

## Background

Users want real-time visibility into agent activities as they happen. Consider
this example UI:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| I will search the internet for relevant information        | <- TextMessage
+------------------------------------------------------------+
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ✓ checking reddit                                          | <- ActivityMessage
| searching X.com...                                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Use Cases

- **Workflows**: Step-by-step progress through workflow execution
- **Planning**: Intermediate planning or tool use visibility
- **Custom frameworks**: Signals representing ongoing work in any agent system

## Challenges

- **Flexibility**: Must handle arbitrary activity data from different frameworks
- **Serializability**: Events must be replayable and rehydrated for session
  recovery
- **Extensibility**: Developers should define custom renderers per activity
  type, with a generic fallback
- **Chronology**: Activities must interleave naturally with chat and run events

## Detailed Specification

### Overview

This proposal introduces two new concepts to the AG-UI protocol:

1. **ActivityEvent**: A new event type in the event stream
2. **ActivityMessage**: A new message type alongside TextMessage, ToolMessage,
   etc.

Frameworks may emit ActivityEvents, and frontends can render them inline with
chat.

### New Event: ActivityEvent

```typescript
type ActivityEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.ACTIVITY
  /**
   * Unique identifier for the ActivityMessage this event belongs to.
   */
  messageId: string
  /**
   * Activity type, e.g. "PLAN", "SEARCH", "SCRAPE"
   */
  activityType: string
  /**
   * Snapshot of the full activity state (optional).
   */
  snapshot?: Record<string, any>
  /**
   * Patch to apply to the prior snapshot (optional).
   * Follows JSON Patch semantics.
   */
  patch?: Record<string, any>
}
```

#### Example Events

Initial activity snapshot:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_001",
  "ts": 1714064100000,
  "type": "ACTIVITY",
  "messageId": "msg_789",
  "activityType": "PLAN",
  "snapshot": {
    "tasks": ["check reddit", "search X.com"]
  }
}
```

Incremental update via patch:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_002",
  "ts": 1714064120000,
  "type": "ACTIVITY",
  "messageId": "msg_789",
  "activityType": "PLAN",
  "patch": {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/tasks/0",
    "value": "✓ check reddit"
  }
}
```

### New Message: ActivityMessage

```typescript
type ActivityMessage = {
  id: string
  role: "activity"
  activityType: string
  /**
   * Finalized activity content as of compaction.
   */
  content: Record<string, any>
}
```

### Rendering Strategy

- **Generic renderer**: Displays raw snapshot/patch as JSON or formatted text
- **Custom renderer**: Developers can register a renderer per `activityType`:
  - `"PLAN"` → Interactive checklist component
  - `"SEARCH"` → Live status with progress indicators
  - `"WORKFLOW"` → Step-by-step workflow visualization

## Implementation Considerations

### Client SDK Changes

TypeScript SDK additions:

- New `ActivityEvent` type in `@ag-ui/core`
- New `ActivityMessage` type in message unions
- Activity renderer registry in `@ag-ui/client`

Python SDK additions:

- New `ActivityEvent` class in `ag_ui.core.events`
- New `ActivityMessage` class in message types
- Activity serialization/deserialization support

### Integration Impact

- **Planning Frameworks**: Can emit ActivityEvents during planning or tool
  execution phases
- **Workflow Systems**: Can surface step-by-step workflow progress as
  ActivityEvents
- **Other frameworks**: May emit ActivityEvents freely; AG-UI will serialize
  them like other events

## Examples and Use Cases

### Example 1: Web Search Activity

```typescript
// Agent emits search activity
agent.emitActivity({
  messageId: "msg_123",
  activityType: "SEARCH",
  snapshot: {
    sources: [
      { name: "Reddit", status: "pending" },
      { name: "X.com", status: "pending" },
      { name: "Google", status: "pending" },
    ],
  },
})

// Update as search progresses
agent.emitActivity({
  messageId: "msg_123",
  activityType: "SEARCH",
  patch: {
    op: "replace",
    path: "/sources/0/status",
    value: "complete",
  },
})
```

### Use Case: Multi-Step Workflow Visibility

A data analysis agent performing multiple steps:

1. Loading dataset → ActivityEvent shows progress bar
2. Cleaning data → ActivityEvent shows rows processed
3. Running analysis → ActivityEvent shows current computation
4. Generating report → ActivityEvent shows sections completed

Each step appears inline with chat, giving users real-time feedback.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for ActivityEvent serialization/deserialization
- Integration tests with mock frameworks emitting ActivityEvents
- E2E tests in AG-UI Dojo demonstrating activity rendering
- Performance benchmarks for high-frequency activity updates
