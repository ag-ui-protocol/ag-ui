# Reasoning Proposal

## Summary

### Problem Statement
LLMs increasingly use chain-of-thought reasoning to improve response quality, but there's no standardized way to surface reasoning signals while maintaining privacy and state continuity across turns.

### Motivation
AG-UI should support **LLM reasoning** without breaking existing apps.

- **Reasoning visibility & continuity**: We must surface reasoning signals (e.g., **reasoning summaries**) and support **encrypted reasoning items** for state carry-over across turns—especially under `store:false`/ZDR—*without exposing raw chain-of-thought*.
- **Backwards compatibility**: Existing AG-UI clients must keep working unchanged. New capabilities should be non-breaking.

## Status

- **Status**: Draft
- **Author(s)**: AG-UI Team

## Detailed Specification

### Overview

This proposal introduces:
- New events for reasoning lifecycle management
- A new `ReasoningMessage` type for message history
- Support for encrypted reasoning content

## New Reasoning Events

These events represent the lifecycle of reasoning messages in a conversation.

### ReasoningStartEvent

Marks the start of reasoning.

```typescript
type ReasoningStartEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.REASONING_START
  messageId: string
  encryptedContent?: string
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messageId` | `string` | Unique identifier of this reasoning |
| `encryptedContent` | `string?` | Optionally the encrypted content |

### ReasoningMessageStartEvent

Signals the start of a reasoning message.

```typescript
type ReasoningMessageStartEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.REASONING_MESSAGE_START
  messageId: string
  role: "assistant"
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messageId` | `string` | Unique identifier of the message |
| `role` | `"assistant"` | Role of the reasoning message |

### ReasoningMessageContentEvent

Represents a chunk of content in a streaming reasoning message.

```typescript
type ReasoningMessageContentEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT
  messageId: string
  delta: string // Non-empty string
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messageId` | `string` | Matches the ID from ReasoningMessageStartEvent |
| `delta` | `string` | Reasoning content chunk (non-empty) |

### ReasoningMessageEndEvent

Signals the end of a reasoning message.

```typescript
type ReasoningMessageEndEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.REASONING_MESSAGE_END
  messageId: string
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messageId` | `string` | Matches the ID from ReasoningMessageStartEvent |

### ReasoningMessageChunkEvent

A convenience event to auto start/close reasoning messages.

```typescript
type ReasoningMessageChunkEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.REASONING_MESSAGE_CHUNK
  messageId?: string
  delta?: string
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messageId` | `string?` | Message ID (first event must be non-empty) |
| `delta` | `string?` | Reasoning content chunk |

### ReasoningEndEvent

Marks the end of reasoning.

```typescript
type ReasoningEndEvent = BaseEvent & {
  type: EventType.REASONING_END
  messageId: string
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messageId` | `string` | Unique identifier of this reasoning |

## New ReasoningMessage Type

```typescript
type ReasoningMessage = {
  id: string
  role: "reasoning"
  content: string[]
  encryptedContent?: string
}
```

## Removed Events

These events have never been publicly documented and will be removed:
- `THINKING_TEXT_MESSAGE_START`
- `THINKING_TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`
- `THINKING_TEXT_MESSAGE_END`

## Implementation Considerations

### Client SDK Changes

TypeScript SDK:
- New event types in `@ag-ui/core`
- ReasoningMessage type in message unions
- Reasoning event handlers in subscriber
- Support for encrypted content handling

Python SDK:
- New event classes in `ag_ui.core.events`
- ReasoningMessage class
- Encryption/decryption utilities

### Privacy and Security

- **Encrypted reasoning**: Support for encrypted reasoning content that clients cannot decrypt
- **State continuity**: Encrypted reasoning items can be passed across turns without exposing content
- **ZDR compliance**: Works with `store:false` and zero data retention policies

### Backward Compatibility

- Clients not handling reasoning events continue to work
- Reasoning messages are optional in message history
- No changes required to existing integrations

## Use Cases

### Chain-of-Thought Visibility
Show users that the model is "thinking" without exposing internal reasoning.

### Reasoning Summaries
Provide high-level summaries of reasoning process for transparency.

### State Continuity
Maintain reasoning context across conversation turns without storing raw content.

### Compliance and Privacy
Meet data retention requirements while preserving reasoning capabilities.

## Examples

### Basic Reasoning Flow

```typescript
// Agent emits reasoning start
{
  "type": "REASONING_START",
  "messageId": "reasoning-001",
  "encryptedContent": "encrypted-blob-xyz"
}

// Stream reasoning content (visible to client)
{
  "type": "REASONING_MESSAGE_START",
  "messageId": "msg-123",
  "role": "assistant"
}

{
  "type": "REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT",
  "messageId": "msg-123",
  "delta": "Let me think through this step by step..."
}

{
  "type": "REASONING_MESSAGE_END",
  "messageId": "msg-123"
}

// End reasoning
{
  "type": "REASONING_END",
  "messageId": "reasoning-001"
}
```

### Convenience Event Usage

```typescript
// Using chunk event for simpler implementation
{
  "type": "REASONING_MESSAGE_CHUNK",
  "messageId": "msg-456",
  "delta": "Analyzing the requirements..."
}

// Auto-closes on next non-reasoning event or empty chunk
{
  "type": "REASONING_MESSAGE_CHUNK",
  "messageId": "msg-456",
  "delta": ""
}
```

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for new event types
- Integration tests with reasoning-capable models
- Backward compatibility tests with existing clients
- Encryption/decryption roundtrip tests
- Performance tests for reasoning event streaming

## Open Questions

1. Should reasoning messages be included in `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` by default?
2. How to handle partial reasoning in case of interruptions?
3. Should we support different reasoning visibility levels (none, summary, full)?
4. What's the maximum size for encrypted reasoning content?
5. Should reasoning events support metadata (e.g., reasoning type, complexity)?
