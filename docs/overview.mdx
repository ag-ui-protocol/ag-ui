# AG‑UI: The Agent–User Interaction Protocol

*A horizontal standard to bring AI agents into user‑facing frontend applications.*

AG‑UI is the boundary layer where agents and users meet. It standardizes how agent state, UI intents, and user interactions flow between your model/agent runtime and your app's frontend—so you can ship reliable, debuggable, user‑friendly agentic features fast.

## Why AG‑UI

**Agentic apps break the classic request/response contract.** Agents run for longer, stream work as they go, and make nondeterministic choices that can affect your UI and state. AG‑UI defines a clean, observable boundary so frontends remain predictable while agents stay flexible.

### What's hard about user‑facing agents

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Long-running and streaming operations">
    Agents are **long‑running** and **stream** intermediate work—often across multi‑turn sessions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Nondeterministic UI control">
    Agents are **nondeterministic** and can **control UI** in ways that must be supervised.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mixed IO requirements">
    Apps must mix **structured + unstructured IO** (text, voice, tool calls, state updates).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent composition">
    Agents need **composition**: agents **call sub‑agents**, often non-deterministically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

With AG‑UI, these become deliberate, well‑typed interactions rather than ad‑hoc wiring.
