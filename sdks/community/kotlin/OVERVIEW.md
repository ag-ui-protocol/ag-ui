# AG-UI Kotlin SDK Overview

AG-UI Kotlin SDK is a Kotlin Multiplatform client library for connecting to AI agents that implement the [Agent User Interaction Protocol (AG-UI)](https://docs.ag-ui.com/). The library provides transport mechanisms, state management, and tool integration for communication between Kotlin applications and AI agents across Android, iOS, and JVM platforms.

## Architecture Summary

AG-UI Kotlin SDK follows the design patterns of the TypeScript SDK while leveraging Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities and coroutine-based concurrency:

- **kotlin-core**: Protocol types, events, and message definitions
- **kotlin-client**: HTTP transport, state management, and high-level agent APIs  
- **kotlin-tools**: Tool execution framework with registry and circuit breakers

The SDK maintains conceptual parity with the TypeScript implementation while providing native Kotlin idioms like sealed classes, suspend functions, and Kotlin Flows for streaming responses.

## Lifecycle subscribers and role fidelity

- **AgentSubscriber hooks** â€“ Agents now expose a subscription API so applications can observe run initialization, per-event delivery, and state mutations before the built-in handlers execute. This enables cross-cutting concerns like analytics, tracing, or custom persistence without forking the pipeline.
- **Role-aware text streaming** â€“ Text message events preserve their declared roles (developer, system, assistant, user) throughout chunk transformation and state application, ensuring downstream UI state mirrors the protocol payloads exactly.
