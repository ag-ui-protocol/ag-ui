/**
 * Interface for subscribing to agent lifecycle events, state changes, and real-time updates.
 * <p>
 * AgentSubscriber provides a comprehensive set of callback methods that allow implementers to
 * monitor and react to various aspects of agent execution, including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Request lifecycle management (initialization, completion, errors)</li>
 * <li>Real-time event streaming during agent execution</li>
 * <li>State and message updates</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All methods have default empty implementations, allowing implementers to selectively
 * override only the events they're interested in.
