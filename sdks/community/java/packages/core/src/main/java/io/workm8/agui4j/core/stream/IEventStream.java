/**
 * Interface for handling reactive event streams with support for data emission, error handling, and completion.
 * <p>
 * This interface follows the reactive streams pattern, allowing consumers to handle a stream of events
 * of type {@code T}. The stream can emit multiple items, terminate with an error, or complete successfully.
 * It also supports cancellation to stop processing early.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical usage pattern:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * IEventStream<String> stream = ...;
 *
 * // Process items as they arrive
 * stream.next("item1");
 * stream.next("item2");
 *
 * // Complete the stream
 * stream.complete();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of items emitted by this stream
