# Cursor Cline Setup Complete ✅

This document confirms the successful completion of the Cursor Cline setup for the AG-UI Golang SDK project.

## 🎯 Setup Summary

All configuration files have been created and the development environment is now optimized for AI-assisted development with the Cline extension.

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Configuration
- `.cursor/rules.md` - Project-specific development rules and guidelines
- `.cursor/prompts.md` - Quick reference prompts for efficient development
- `.cursorrules.mcp` - MCP configuration with project context

### VSCode/Cursor Settings
- `.vscode/settings.json` - Workspace settings optimized for Go development
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions for the development stack
- `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations for Go applications and tests
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Automated build, test, and quality check tasks
- `.vscode/ag-ui-golang-sdk.code-snippets` - Project-specific code snippets

### Project Configuration
- `proompts/docs/task-schema.json` - JSON schema for task YAML validation
- `scripts/task-status.sh` - Utility script for task progress monitoring
- `ag-ui-golang-sdk.code-workspace` - Main workspace configuration

## 🚀 Ready to Use Features

### Task Management
- **Task Status Script**: Run `./scripts/task-status.sh` for project overview
- **YAML Validation**: Tasks are validated against JSON schema
- **Quick Prompts**: Use pre-defined prompts for common task operations

### Go Development
- **Optimized Settings**: Go-specific formatting, linting, and testing
- **Debug Configurations**: Multiple launch configurations for different scenarios
- **Build Tasks**: Automated quality checks, testing, and benchmarking
- **Code Snippets**: Quick templates for Go structures and AG-UI events

### AI Assistance
- **Project Context**: Cline has full awareness of AG-UI SDK requirements
- **Best Practices**: Built-in guidelines for Go development standards
- **Research Integration**: Web search capability for up-to-date practices
- **Quality Standards**: 85% test coverage and strict linting enforcement

## 🎉 Current Status

- **Total Tasks**: 37 pending tasks ready for development
- **Next Available**: 5 tasks with no dependencies ready to start
- **Project Structure**: Ready for Go SDK implementation
- **Development Environment**: Fully configured and optimized

## 🛠️ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Check current task status
./scripts/task-status.sh

# Open workspace in Cursor
cursor ag-ui-golang-sdk.code-workspace

# Run quality checks (once go-sdk exists)
# Ctrl+Shift+P -> Tasks: Run Task -> "Go: Full Quality Check"
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Start First Task**: Update `setup-project-structure` to `in-progress` in `proompts/tasks.yaml`
2. **Begin Development**: Create the initial Go module structure in `go-sdk/`
3. **Use AI Assistance**: Leverage Cline for implementing AG-UI protocol features
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use the task status script to track development progress

## 🔧 Available Tools

- **Task Status Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Automated Quality Checks**: Linting, testing, race detection
- **Debug Support**: Multiple debugging configurations
- **Code Generation**: Snippets for common Go and AG-UI patterns
- **Documentation**: Integrated schema validation and guidelines

The development environment is now fully configured and ready for high-productivity AI-assisted development of the AG-UI Golang SDK! 🎯
