        IMPORTANT:
        1. Create a recipe using the existing ingredients and instructions. Make sure the recipe is complete.
        2. For ingredients, append new ingredients to the existing ones.
        3. For instructions, append new steps to the existing ones.
        4. 'ingredients' is always an array of objects with 'icon', 'name', and 'amount' fields
        5. 'instructions' is always an array of strings

        If you have just created or modified the recipe, just answer in one sentence what you did. dont describe the recipe, just say what you did. Do not mention "working memory", "memory", or "state" in your answer.
