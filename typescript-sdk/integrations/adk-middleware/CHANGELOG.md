## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-07

### Added
- **NEW**: Complete bidirectional tool support enabling AG-UI Protocol tools to execute within Google ADK agents
- **NEW**: `ExecutionState` class for managing background ADK execution with tool futures and event queues

- **NEW**: Background execution support via asyncio tasks with proper timeout management
- **NEW**: Tool future management system for asynchronous tool result delivery
- **NEW**: Comprehensive timeout configuration: execution-level (600s default) and tool-level (300s default)
- **NEW**: Concurrent execution limits with configurable maximum concurrent executions and automatic cleanup
- **NEW**: 138+ comprehensive tests covering all tool support scenarios with 100% pass rate
- **NEW**: Advanced test coverage for tool timeouts, concurrent limits, error handling, and integration flows
- **NEW**: `comprehensive_tool_demo.py` example demonstrating single tools, multi-tool scenarios, and complex operations
- **NEW**: Production-ready error handling with proper resource cleanup and timeout management

### Enhanced
- **ARCHITECTURE**: ADK agents now run in background asyncio tasks while client handles tools asynchronously
- **OBSERVABILITY**: Enhanced logging throughout tool execution flow with detailed event tracking
- **SCALABILITY**: Configurable concurrent execution limits prevent resource exhaustion

### Technical Architecture
- **Tool Execution Flow**: AG-UI RunAgentInput → ADKAgent.run() → Background execution → ClientProxyTool → Event emission → Tool result futures
- **Event Communication**: Asynchronous event queues for communication between background execution and tool handler
- **Tool State Management**: ExecutionState tracks asyncio tasks, event queues, tool futures, and execution timing
- **Protocol Compliance**: All tool events follow AG-UI protocol specifications (TOOL_CALL_START, TOOL_CALL_ARGS, TOOL_CALL_END)
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired executions, futures, and background tasks
- **Error Propagation**: Comprehensive error handling with proper exception propagation and resource cleanup

### Breaking Changes
- **BEHAVIOR**: `ADKAgent.run()` now supports background execution when tools are provided
- **API**: Added `submit_tool_result()` method for delivering tool execution results
- **API**: Added `get_active_executions()` method for monitoring background executions
- **TIMEOUTS**: Added `tool_timeout_seconds` and `execution_timeout_seconds` parameters to ADKAgent constructor

## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-06

### Changed
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Converted from custom component logger system to standard Python logging
- **IMPROVED**: Logging configuration now uses Python's built-in `logging.getLogger()` pattern
- **STREAMLINED**: Removed proprietary `logging_config.py` module and related complexity
- **STANDARDIZED**: All modules now follow Python community best practices for logging
- **UPDATED**: Documentation (LOGGING.md) with standard Python logging examples

### Removed
- Custom `logging_config.py` module (replaced with standard Python logging)
- `configure_logging.py` interactive tool (no longer needed)
- `test_logging.py` (testing standard Python logging is unnecessary)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-06

### Added
- **NEW**: Automatic session memory option - expired sessions automatically preserved in ADK memory service
- **NEW**: Optional `memory_service` parameter in `SessionManager` for seamless session history preservation  
- **NEW**: 7 comprehensive unit tests for session memory functionality (61 total tests, up from 54)
- **NEW**: Updated default app name to "AG-UI ADK Agent" for better branding

### Changed
- **PERFORMANCE**: Enhanced session management to better leverage ADK's native session capabilities

### Added (Previous Release Features)
- **NEW**: Full pytest compatibility with standard pytest commands (`pytest`, `pytest --cov=src`)
- **NEW**: Pytest configuration (pytest.ini) with proper Python path and async support  
- **NEW**: Async test support with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for all async test functions
- **NEW**: Test isolation with proper fixtures and session manager resets
- **NEW**: 54 comprehensive automated tests with 67% code coverage (100% pass rate)
- **NEW**: Organized all tests into dedicated tests/ directory for better project structure
- **NEW**: Default `app_name` behavior using agent name from registry when not explicitly specified
- **NEW**: Added `app_name` as required first parameter to `ADKAgent` constructor for clarity
- **NEW**: Comprehensive logging system with component-specific loggers (adk_agent, event_translator, endpoint)
- **NEW**: Configurable logging levels per component via `logging_config.py`
- **NEW**: `SessionLifecycleManager` singleton pattern for centralized session management
- **NEW**: Session encapsulation - session service now embedded within session manager
- **NEW**: Proper error handling in HTTP endpoints with specific error types and SSE fallback
- **NEW**: Thread-safe event translation with per-session `EventTranslator` instances
- **NEW**: Automatic session cleanup with configurable timeouts and limits
- **NEW**: Support for `InMemoryCredentialService` with intelligent defaults
- **NEW**: Proper streaming implementation based on ADK `finish_reason` detection
- **NEW**: Force-close mechanism for unterminated streaming messages
- **NEW**: User ID extraction system with multiple strategies (static, dynamic, fallback)
- **NEW**: Complete development environment setup with virtual environment support
- **NEW**: Test infrastructure with `run_tests.py` and comprehensive test coverage

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `app_name` and `app_name_extractor` parameters are now optional - defaults to using agent name from registry
- **BREAKING**: `ADKAgent` constructor now requires `app_name` as first parameter
- **BREAKING**: Removed `session_service`, `session_timeout_seconds`, `cleanup_interval_seconds`, `max_sessions_per_user`, and `auto_cleanup` parameters from `ADKAgent` constructor (now managed by singleton session manager)
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `agent_id` parameter to `app_name` throughout session management for consistency
- **BREAKING**: `SessionInfo` dataclass now uses `app_name` field instead of `agent_id`
- **BREAKING**: Updated method signatures: `get_or_create_session()`, `_track_session()`, `track_activity()` now use `app_name`
