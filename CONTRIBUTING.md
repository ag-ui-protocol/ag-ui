# Contributing to AG-UI

Thanks for your interest in improving **AG-UI**!

This short guide shows the fastest way to get your idea merged.

## 1. Start a Discussion

Before writing code, open a new **Discussion** and briefly cover:

1. **Problem** – what you’re trying to solve.
2. **Proposal** – how you plan to solve it (code, docs, design, etc.).
3. **Alternatives** – other options you considered.

Early feedback keeps everyone aligned and saves re-work.
