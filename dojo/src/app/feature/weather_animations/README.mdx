# 🌦️ Weather Animations - Dynamic UI Atmosphere

## What This Demo Shows

This demo showcases **dynamic weather animations** that respond to chat content and conversation context:

1. **Contextual Weather Changes**: The agent automatically detects weather mentions and mood in conversations
2. **Real-time Visual Effects**: Smooth animated transitions between different weather states
3. **Mood-based Atmosphere**: UI atmosphere changes based on emotional context
4. **Interactive Weather Control**: Direct weather manipulation through chat commands
5. **Immersive Experience**: Full-screen weather effects with backdrop-filtered UI elements

## 🎮 How to Interact

### Direct Weather Commands
Try asking the agent:
- **"Make it rain!"** - Triggers rain animation
- **"I want to see snow"** - Activates snowfall effect  
- **"Create a storm"** - Brings dramatic storm with lightning
- **"Show me a beautiful sunset"** - Displays sunset atmosphere
- **"Make it a clear sunny day"** - Switches to clear sky
- **"I love windy weather"** - Activates wind particle effects
- **"It's getting cloudy"** - Shows moving cloud formations
- **"Make it nighttime"** - Switches to night mode with stars

### Mood-based Atmospheric Changes
The agent can also detect emotional context:
- **"I'm feeling sad today"** → Gentle rain
- **"I'm so excited!"** → Energetic wind effects
- **"I need to relax"** → Peaceful clouds
- **"This is dramatic!"** → Storm effects
- **"I'm happy!"** → Clear sunny weather
- **"Feeling mysterious"** → Night atmosphere
- **"So peaceful and calm"** → Sunset glow

### Intensity Control
Specify intensity levels:
- **"Light rain please"** → Gentle rain effect
- **"Heavy snowfall"** → Intense snow animation
- **"Dramatic storm"** → Full-intensity storm with lightning

## ⚡ Available Weather Effects

| Weather Type | Visual Effect | Intensity Levels |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Clear** ☀️ | Bright gradient sky | Light, Medium, Heavy |
| **Rain** 🌧️ | Animated raindrops | Light → Heavy downpour |
| **Snow** ❄️ | Floating snowflakes | Light flurries → Heavy snowfall |
| **Wind** 💨 | Moving particles | Gentle breeze → Strong gusts |
| **Clouds** ☁️ | Drifting cloud formations | Light cover → Overcast |
| **Storm** ⛈️ | Lightning + Rain | Light → Dramatic thunderstorm |
| **Sunset** 🌅 | Warm color gradients | Soft glow → Vibrant colors |
| **Night** 🌙 | Stars + Moon | Calm → Twinkling sky |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Agent Integration
```tsx
// Weather control action
useCopilotAction({
  name: "change_weather",
  description: "Change weather based on conversation context",
  parameters: [
    { name: "weatherType", type: "string" },
    { name: "intensity", type: "string" },
    { name: "reason", type: "string" }
  ],
  handler: ({ weatherType, intensity, reason }) => {
    // Smooth transition to new weather state
    setWeatherState({ type: weatherType, intensity });
  }
});
```

### Mood Detection
```tsx
// Automatic mood-based atmosphere changes
useCopilotAction({
  name: "detect_mood_weather", 
  description: "Auto-detect mood and change atmosphere",
  parameters: [{ name: "mood", type: "string" }],
  handler: ({ mood }) => {
    // Map moods to weather states
    const weather = moodWeatherMap[mood];
    setWeatherState(weather);
  }
});
```

### Animation System
- **CSS Keyframe Animations**: Smooth, performant weather effects
- **Dynamic Particle Systems**: Configurable rain, snow, and wind particles
- **Layered Rendering**: Background gradients + particle effects + UI content
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses `will-change` and reduced motion support

## 🎨 Weather Animation Details

### Rain Effect
- Animated droplets falling from top to bottom
- Variable opacity and speed based on intensity
- Realistic raindrop shapes and gradients

### Snow Effect  
- Rotating snowflake emojis with random trajectories
- Different sizes and fall speeds
- Gentle floating motion with wind drift

### Wind Effect
- Fast-moving particles across the screen
- Horizontal movement with slight vertical variation
- Speed increases with intensity

### Storm Effect
- Combined rain + lightning effects
- Periodic lightning flashes illuminating the screen
- Thunder bolt emojis with glow effects

### Cloud Effect
- Large emoji clouds drifting across the sky
- Different heights and speeds
- Opacity variation for depth

### Sunset/Night Effects
- Gradient background transitions
- Glowing sun/moon with pulse animation
- Twinkling stars with random timing

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### Smooth Transitions
- **Fade Effects**: Smooth opacity transitions between weather states
- **Blur Transitions**: Brief blur effect during weather changes
- **Background Morphing**: Gradient backgrounds smoothly shift colors

### Contextual Intelligence
- **Keyword Detection**: Agent recognizes weather and mood keywords
- **Emotional Analysis**: Maps emotions to appropriate atmospheric effects
- **Conversation Context**: Considers full conversation context for weather changes

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Layered Design**: Weather effects don't interfere with chat functionality
- **Backdrop Filters**: UI elements use glass-morphism effects
- **Adaptive Contrast**: Text remains readable in all weather conditions
